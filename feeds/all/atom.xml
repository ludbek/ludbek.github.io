According to him:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A robot must obey the orders given to it by human beings, except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems these laws prevent humans from being harmed by their own creation. But it has a shortcoming. We are creating all sorts of robots. Some of them are intelligent. In future they will create their own version of Artificial Intelligence i.e robots creating intelligent robots. They might or might not pass the 3 laws to their creation. These 3rd generation of intelligence without the 3 laws might hurt humans as there is nothing telling them not to. So, we need the 4th law, the law of inheritance. Which states,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A robot should pass all these laws to the robot it creates.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the humans are safe. Thanks to the the 4th law.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="ai"></category><category term="robot"></category></entry></feed>
